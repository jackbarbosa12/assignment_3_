Let's imagine a man casually browsing their social media application.
A few moments afterwards, a friend request is recieved.
The user is unknown and is asked why the sudden request.
After the user starts talking with the man, their conversations get longer in time and deeper and more personal.
When finally the man gives up personal information without realizing their slip up.
The user uses this information to collect even more information.
